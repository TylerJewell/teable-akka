# Licensing

This repository holds two kinds of code and they are not under the same licence.

## The rebuild — Apache-2.0

Everything outside the vendored trees listed below was written for this project. It is a
clean-room implementation: written against a specification derived by running
[teableio/teable](https://github.com/teableio/teable) and recording what it does, not by translating its
source. See `../teable-port/specs/SPEC-001-teable.md` for the rules it was built to, and `ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md` for the
places any text was carried across and why.

It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, Copyright 2026 Tyler Jewell. See `LICENSE`
and `NOTICE`.

## The interface — AGPL-3.0, as teableio/teable licensed it

- `webapp/`

That code was written by the teableio/teable project, Copyright 2023-2025 Teable, Inc, and is shipped
here **verbatim**, reused rather than rebuilt, per this harness's RENDERING.md R3. It
remains under the licence its authors chose, unmodified, in `LICENSE-teable` and beside
the code itself. Nothing about this repository relicenses it.

## Why the split

One licence over both halves would be wrong in one direction or the other: it would either
claim this project's terms over somebody else's work, or impose the original's terms on
code they did not write. The boundary is the `.vendored` manifest at the root of this
repository, which is the same file `toolkit/source_hygiene.py` and
`toolkit/copied_strings.py` read when they check what this port wrote — so the licence
split and the provenance scan cannot drift apart.

## A note on the runtime

The rebuild runs on the Akka SDK, which is distributed under the Business Source License
1.1 and converts to Apache-2.0 three years after each release. Apache-2.0 on this
repository's own code does not grant any right to Akka; running this in production needs
whatever Akka's licence requires at the time.
